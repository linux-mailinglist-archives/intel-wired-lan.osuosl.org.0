Well, with your suggestions against other optimizations like avoiding
a checking in fast patch and avoid calling virt_to_page(), the overhead
is kind of added up.

And I am really surprised by your above suggestion about deciding the
API for users according to the internal implementation detail here. As
the overhead of calculating 'va' is really depending on the layout of
'struct page_frag_cache' here, what if we change the implementation and
the overhead of calculating 'va' becomes bigger? Do we expect to change
the API for the callers when we change the internal implementation of
page_frag_cache?

I am supposing you meant something like below:
struct page *page_frag_alloc_pg(struct page_frag_cache *nc,
				unsigned int *offset, unsigned int fragsz,
				gfp_t gfp)
{
	struct page *page;
	void *va;

	va = page_frag_alloc_va(nc, fragsz, gfp);
	if (!va)
		return NULL;

	page = virt_to_head_page(va);
	*offset = va - page_to_virt(page);

	return page;
}

If yes, I really think you are caring about maintainability too much by
trading off too much performance here by not only recalculating the offset
here, but also sometimes calling virt_to_head_page() unnecessarily.

If no, please share the pseudo code in your mind.

I am supposing the 3 different variants meant the below, right?
1. page_frag_alloc_va() returns [va].
2. page_frag_alloc_pg() returns [page, offset].
3. page_frag_alloc() returns [va] & [page, offset].

And there is others 3 different variants for prepare API too:
4. page_frag_alloc_va_prepare() returns [va].
5. page_frag_alloc_pg_prepare() returns [page, offset].
6. page_frag_alloc_prepare() returns [va] & [page, offset].

Side note: I just found the '4. page_frag_alloc_va_prepare()' API is
not used/called currently and can be removed in next revision for this
patchset.

It seems what you really want is 3 & 2 to be a wrapper for 1, and
5 & 6 to be a wrapper for 4?

If yes, too much performance is traded off here as my understanding.
Does't the introducing of __page_frag_cache_reload() already enable the
balance between performance and maintainability as much as possible in
patch 8?

I am not starting to use page_frag as the container yet, but the above
part is something that I am probably agreed with.

I don't really think breaking this patchset into more patchsets without
a newcase is helping to speed up the process here, it might slow down
the process instead, as the different idea about the refactoring and
new API naming is not going to disappear by breaking the patchset, and
the breaking may make the discussion harder without a bigger picture
and context.
