Sorry we cannot finish the testset for your branch within a reasonable time.
It's our fault -- either some build server is down or some build worker is busy
doing bisects for _other_ trees. The branch will get more complete coverage and
possible error reports when our build infrastructure is restored or catches up.
There will be no more build success notification for this branch head, but you
can expect reasonably good test coverage after waiting for 1 day.
