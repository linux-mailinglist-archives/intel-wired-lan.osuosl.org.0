Well I still never heard anything from anyone.  Just installed 4.10
firmware in case that security fix (the only change to happen in over
12 months) did something, but no.

So all UDP encapsulated IPsec packets still always have RSS value of 0.

I am tempted to write a test to see if all UDP encapsulated IP packets
that are not of one of the explicitly handled types have this problem
since I have a suspicion they do.
