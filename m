Ah, you're right, I missed the fact that pci_enable_rom() would do the
write.

Yes, I understand that.  I think it's better to do the update in
pci_std_update_resource() instead of relying on a future fixup or
pci_enable_rom().  There's no explicit connection between the
assignment and the BAR write, so it's fragile.

I intended to change the quirk from FINAL to EARLY, but obviously
forgot.  Here's the updated version:

commit bb5639b73a2d ("PCI: Work around Intel I210 ROM BAR overlap defect")
Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 21 10:45:07 2021 -0600

    PCI: Work around Intel I210 ROM BAR overlap defect
    
    Per PCIe r5, sec 7.5.1.2.4, a device must not claim accesses to its
    Expansion ROM unless both the Memory Space Enable and the Expansion ROM
    Enable bit are set.  But apparently some Intel I210 NICs don't work
    correctly if the ROM BAR overlaps another BAR, even if the Expansion ROM is
    disabled.
    
    Michael reported that on a Kontron SMARC-sAL28 ARM64 system with U-Boot
    v2021.01-rc3, the ROM BAR overlaps BAR 3, and networking doesn't work at
    all:
    
      BAR 0: 0x40000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]
      BAR 3: 0x40200000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
      ROM:   0x40200000 (disabled) [size=1M]
    
      NETDEV WATCHDOG: enP2p1s0 (igb): transmit queue 0 timed out
      Hardware name: Kontron SMARC-sAL28 (Single PHY) on SMARC Eval 2.0 carrier (DT)
      igb 0002:01:00.0 enP2p1s0: Reset adapter
    
    Previously, pci_std_update_resource() wrote the assigned ROM address to the
    BAR only when the ROM was enabled.  This meant that the I210 ROM BAR could
    be left with an address assigned by firmware, which might overlap with
    other BARs.
    
    Quirk these I210 devices so pci_std_update_resource() always writes the
    assigned address to the ROM BAR, whether or not the ROM is enabled.
