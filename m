[Cc: regressions@lists.linux.dev]

TLDR; for the regression folks: This is about a two year old commit 
first appearing in Linux 6.7 (so after the 6.6 LTS series release), part 
of which Red Hat reverted in their distro last year to address the 
userspace regression. Users hit by this might not be able to log into 
their systems due to the network not being configured.


Dear Calvin, dear Przemek,


Thank you for raising this issue.

Too bad Red Hat didnâ€™t report this over a year ago upstream.

I disagree. Debian admins do not upgrade their servers to the newest 
stable release right away to exactly avoid such issues. So Iâ€™d argue, as 
with Red Hat, that the change should be reverted as soon as possible, 
before even more users are hit by this.

But, as Przemek is one of the two subsystem maintainers, I guess his 
opinion matters quite a lot.


Kind regards,

Paul
