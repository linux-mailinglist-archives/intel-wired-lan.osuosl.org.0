If the hardware is constantly receiving unicast or broadcast packets
during driver load, the device previously counted many GLV_RDPC (VSI
dropped packets) events during init. This causes confusing dropped
packet statistics during driver load. The dropped packets counter
incrementing does stop once the driver finishes loading.

Avoid this problem by baselining our statistics at the end of driver
open instead of the end of probe.

Fixes: cdedef59deb0 ("ice: Configure VSIs for Tx/Rx")

Testing Hints: pktgen or ping flood the DUT, while reloading the driver
and bringing up the interface (in a script or with networkmanager) and
note dropped packets with ip -s -s link or ifconfig, after this patch
there should be none.
