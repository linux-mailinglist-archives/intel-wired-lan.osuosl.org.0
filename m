Sorry for the unclear explanation, I was having trouble summarizing what it 
does.

Snippets of what TQAVCTRL.PREEMPT_ENA does from i226 documentation:

RX:
When preemption is enabled by the PREEMPT_ENA flag in TQAVCTRL register, 
Express traffic is routed to the high priority packet buffer and Best 
Effort traffic is routed to the low priority packet buffer.				
The receive unit re-assemble the received fragments back to whole packets. 
It classifies the incoming mPackets as whole packets or packets fragments 
that should be re-assembled. Classification is done based on the SMD, 
Fragment Count and the CRC. Foxville categorizes received packets by SMD 
only when preemption is enabled by the TQAVCTRL.PREEMPT_ENA.

TX:
TQAVCTRL.PREEMPT_ENA (Enables the transmit preemption state machine): This 
is a dynamic parameter that can be set while the transmit unit is active. 
Setting takes affect at whole packet boundaries.
Preemptable: Each transmit queue can be set as Preemptive - eTXQ for 
express traffic or Preemptable pTXQ for non-Express traffic. The pTXQs can 
be preempted by The eTXQs when preemption is enabled by the 
TQAVCTRL.PREEMPT_ENA


Based on my testing, this register bit needs to be enabled for the i226 to 
receive verify/response frames, which is why I added the phrase 
"verification handshake capability."

Do you think I should omit the explanation of TQAVCTRL.PREEMPT_ENA ?
Or would it be better for me to attempt to summarize it more clearly in the 
next version? Hmmm.

As opposed to something like a "queue context parameter".
In the i226 documentation, the terms "global parameter" and "queue context 
parameter" are commonly used. "Global" refers to NIC-wide settings, whereas 
"queue context" refers to parameters specific to a particular TX queue. I 
thought it would be useful to highlight this distinction for the reader, 
and it aligns with the style of explanation used in the i226 documentation.

Would it be better to remove the word "Global"?

I initially stop execution, but then I figured if the other parameters are 
set correctly, the feature could still work since this field has a valid 
default value set.

I'll update it to stop execution then.

You mean, to make igc_tsn_offload_apply() return void ?

Currently, igc_tsn_offload_apply() calls igc_tsn_reset(), which can return 
a non-zero value, but igc_tsn_offload_apply() doesn't use that result and 
always returns zero. It seems more logical to modify 
igc_tsn_offload_apply() to handle the return value from igc_tsn_reset().

What do you think ?

But... should this change be in this series though ?

Yeah, I can reuse ethtool_mm_frag_size_min_to_add(), but it will need some 
modifications. See my reply below

Thanks for the suggestion! I was actually about to suggest option 2 myself, 
but you got there first.

To recap:

Standard range: 60, 124, 188, 252 (without mCRC).
i226 range: 64, 128, 192, 256 (without mCRC).

The current IGC_TX_MIN_FRAG_SIZE is incorrectly set to 68 due to our 
misinterpretation of the i226 documentation:
"The minimum size for non-final preempted fragments is 64 * (1 + MIN_FRAG) 
+ 4 (mCRC)."

The calculation above is for the fragment size on the wire, including mCRC. 
For the TX preemption point and pure fragment size, mCRC should not be 
included, as confirmed by the hardware owner.

On RX, i226 can handle any size, even the standard minimum of 60 octets 
(without mCRC).

What would be ideal for i226:
Min frag user set 60:64 → Multiplier = 0.
Min frag user set 65:128 → Multiplier = 1.
(And so on)

To make this work and reuse the existing code, we’d need to tweak these two 
functions:
ethtool_mm_frag_size_add_to_min(val_min, xxx)
ethtool_mm_frag_size_min_to_add(xx)

With the current code, if I pass 64 octets as val_min to 
ethtool_mm_frag_size_add_to_min(), it returns error.

Proposed modification:
Add a new parameter to ethtool_mm_frag_size_min_to_add() - maybe let's call 
it dev_min_tx_frag_len.

Set dev_min_tx_frag_len = 64 for i226, 60 for other drivers.
This field will be used to:
(1) modify the calculation in ethtool_mm_frag_size_min_to_add()
(2) as a warning prompt to user when the value is not standard, done in 
ethtool_mm_frag_size_add_to_min()

I was thinking (1) would modify the existing:
u32 ethtool_mm_frag_size_add_to_min(u32 val_add)
{
	return (ETH_ZLEN + ETH_FCS_LEN) * (1 + val_add) - ETH_FCS_LEN;
}

To something like:
u32 ethtool_mm_frag_size_add_to_min(u32 val_add, u32 dev_min_tx_frag_len)
{
     return dev_min_tx_frag_len + (val_add * 64);
}

So this will yield:
Standard range (dev_min_tx_frag_len = 60): 60, 124, 188, 252
i226 range (dev_min_tx_frag_len = 64): 64, 128, 192, 256

But what's not so nice is, the rest of other drivers have to set this new 
param when calling ethtool_mm_frag_size_add_to_min().

Is something like this okay ? I'm open to better suggestion.
