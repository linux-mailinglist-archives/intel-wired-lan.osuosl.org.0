Seems reasonable to me. One bikeshed, that you can safely discard and 
ignore as a mere bikeshed: kfree_memzero or kfree_scrub or 
kfree_{someverb} seems like a better function name, as it describes what 
the function does, rather than "_sensitive" that suggests something 
about the data maybe but who knows what that entails. If you disagree, 
not a big deal either way.

This had occurred to me momentarily a number of years ago, but I was 
under the impression that the kernel presumes extern function calls to 
always imply a compiler barrier, making it difficult for the compiler to 
reason about what happens in/after kfree, in order to be able to 
optimize out the preceding memset. With LTO, that rule obviously 
changes. I guess new code should be written with cross-object 
optimizations in mind now a days? [Meanwhile, it would be sort of 
interesting to teach gcc about kfree to enable additional scary 
optimizations...]
