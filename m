It is about the pool having the list of pages that need to be unmapped.
The point is that the list of pages that need to be unmapped is dynamic,
it is not a static list:
1. How to find a empty space in the list and add a page to the list?
2. How to find a page in the list and delete it from the list?
3. How to do the about two steps concurrently without obvious overhead?

I am not sure how it is possible to do the above without something like
the 'pp_item' added in this patch? Even the lockless list in the
include/linux/llist.h need a 'struct llist_node' for that to work.
But if it is possible, please share the idea in your mind.

Maybe, let's see if there is some stronger argument that it is not ok
to add the limitation or some testing that does show the limitation
does bring a regression.

It seems like the similar assumption made about the normal page.
How is dmabuf layer able to handles the unmapping when the driver
which creates the page_pool with the devmem pages has unbound and
the 'struct device' behind the driver has became invalid?

If dmabuf layer is able to handle that, it seems the page_pool may
be able to handle that too. Adding the maintainers of Dma-buf to see
if there is some clarifying from them.
