> The function ice_dcb_rebuild had some logic flaws in it, and also didn't
> differentiate between FW and SW modes needs.
> 
> For FW flow, the willing setting was being forced to OFF and left that way.
> Unwilling in DCB FW mode is not a supported model.
> 
> Leave the config alone and use the return value from the set command to
> determine if setting the config was successful.
> 
> The SW DCB flow does not need to need to register for MIB change events
> (as they are not used in SW mode).
> 
> Use !is_sw_lldp checks to only perform FW specific task while in FW mode.
> 
> Also adding a reapplication of the current DCB config after a link event.  Some
> NVMs are not maintaining their DCB configs across link events.
>
