> As to why this doesn't go to tc but to ethtool: why would it go to tc?

Maybe you can't %100 duplicate the on-the-wire special format and
whatever, but the queueing behavior ABSOLUTELY you can emulate in
software.

And then you have the proper hooks added for HW offload which can
do the on-the-wire stuff.

That's how we do these things, not with bolted on ethtool stuff.
