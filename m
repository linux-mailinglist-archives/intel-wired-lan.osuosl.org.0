There is now yes.  :-D

I've been trying to follow that thread.

Yes I agree.  We absolutely don't want more kmap*() calls and I was hoping to
dovetail into your kmap_local() work.[2]

I've pivoted away from this work a bit to clean up all the
kmap()/memcpy*()/kunmaps() as discussed elsewhere in the thread first.[3]  I
was hoping your work would land and then I could s/kmap_thread()/kmap_local()/
on all of these patches.

Also, we can convert the new memcpy_*_page() calls to kmap_local() as well.
[For now my patch just uses kmap_atomic().]

I've not looked at all of the patches in your latest version.  Have you
included converting any of the kmap() call sites?  I thought you were more
focused on converting the kmap_atomic() to kmap_local()?
