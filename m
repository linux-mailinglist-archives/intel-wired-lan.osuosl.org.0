During rebuild ice_ena_vsi() is called to recover the VSI state.
This function assumes the PF VSI is always to be enabled, however,
it's possible that during reset/rebuild the interface can be
brought down.  If this occurs, we can attempt to bring up the PF
VSI on a downed interface which can lead to various crashes. If
the interface is not running, do not bring up the associated VSI.
