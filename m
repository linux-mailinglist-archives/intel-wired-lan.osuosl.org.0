Sorry for the long delay.

About PTP_SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED, I did play with it a bit, but I didn't
like it too much: because I don't have access to all the timestamps from
the same "cycle", I ended up having to run two cycles to retrieve all
the information.

So, the new version will expose the timestamps via
PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE, later we can think of PTP_SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED.
