> Remove code that tell the OS that link is going down when user change flow
> control via ethtool. When link is up it isn't certain that link goes down after
> 0x0605 aq command. If link doesn't go down, OS thinks that link is down, but
> physical link is up. To reset this state user have to take interface down and
> up.
> 
> If link goes down after 0x0605 command, FW send information about that
> and after that driver tells the OS that the link goes down. So this code in
> ethtool is unnecessary.
