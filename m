Well, I used git.  It says that as of today in Linus' tree we have 889
patches related to fall throughs and the first series went in in
october 2017 ... ignoring a couple of outliers back to February.

We're also complaining about the inability to recruit maintainers:

https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/30/hard_to_find_linux_maintainers_says_torvalds/

And burn out:

http://antirez.com/news/129

The whole crux of your argument seems to be maintainers' time isn't
important so we should accept all trivial patches ... I'm pushing back
on that assumption in two places, firstly the valulessness of the time
and secondly that all trivial patches are valuable.

What I'm actually trying to articulate is a way of measuring value of
the patch vs cost ... it has nothing really to do with who foots the
actual bill.

One thesis I'm actually starting to formulate is that this continual
devaluing of maintainers is why we have so much difficulty keeping and
recruiting them.
