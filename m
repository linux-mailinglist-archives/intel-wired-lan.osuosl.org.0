Indeed. It means that there will be an uphill battle to remove the
INTx/MSI confusion in a lot of drivers (Barry says about 700 of them,
and I can't say I'm surprised).

We can probably tackle that as a background task for the next few
releases (I need to relearn Coccinelle for the 27th time...).

Thanks,
