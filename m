6GB of RAM for each NUMA node? That sounds, well, a whole lot :-D Makes
me also wonder a bit why nobody else reported this (and if you have any
debug option enable in your .config or something like that that which is
rarely used).

Whatever: to me it still feels like this regression is not handled as
Linus would want it, but I'm not totally sure and guess I have to admit
that I'm out of my depth here. I'll let my regression tracking bot
continue monitor this, but will most likely leave things to the network
and driver maintainers from here on unless something changes.

Ciao, Thorsten
