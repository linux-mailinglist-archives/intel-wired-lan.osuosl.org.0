I couldn't agree more. And because of that, I stick with the following
approach because it's maintainable longer-term than "type(pos) pos" one:
 Implements a new macro for each list_for_each_entry* with _inside suffix.
  #define list_for_each_entry_inside(pos, type, head, member)

I have posted a patch series here to demonstrate this approach:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220301075839.4156-3-xiam0nd.tong@gmail.com/

Although we need replace all the use of list_for_each_entry* (15000+)
with list_for_each_entry*_inside, the work can be done gradually rather
than all at once. We can incrementally replace these callers until
all these in the kernel are completely updated with *_inside* one. At
that time, we can just remove the implements of origin macros and rename
the *_inside* macro back to the origin name just in one single patch.

And the "type(pos) pos" approach need teach developers to "not initialize
the iterator variable, otherwise the use-after-loop will not be reported by
compiler", which is unreasonable and impossible for all developers. 

And it will mess up the following code logic and no warnning reported by
compiler, even without initializing "ext" at the beginning:
void foo(struct mem_extent *arg) {
  struct mem_extent *ext;  // used both for iterator and normal ptr
  ...
  ext = arg;  // this assignment can alse be done in another bar() func
  ...
  list_for_each_entry(ext, head, member) {
    if (found(ext))
       break;
  }
  ...
  // use ext after the loop
  ret = ext;
}
If the loop hit the break, the last "ret" will be the found ext iterator.
However, if the "type(pos) pos" approach applied, the last "ret" will be
"arg" which is not the intention of the developers, because the "ext" is
two different variables inside and outside the loop.

Thus, my idea is *better a finger off than always aching*, let's choose
the "list_for_each_entry_inside(pos, type, head, member)" approach.

we can pass a shorter type name to list_for_each_entry_inside, thus no
need to split it over two lines. Actually it is not a big problem.
+ #define t struct sram_bank_info
- list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member) {
+ list_for_each_entry_inside(pos, t, head, member) {

I put the type at the second argument not the first to avoid messing up
the pattern match in some coccinelle scripts.

sometimes developers can be confused by the reported warnning:
"used without having been initialized", and can not figure out immediately
that "oh, now i am using another different variable but with the same name
of the loop iterator variable", which has changed the programming habits
of developers.

It will lead to a wrong/NULL pointer dereference if the pointer is used
anywhere else, depend on which value is used to initialized with.
